# Humid Terraform Provider

## What is humid?

If you're wondering what humid is, you can find more information in the [humid GitHub repo](https://github.com/kscarlett/humid)

## Usage

I'd recommend against using this for now as I'm actively working on it.

If that doesn't deter you though, you can follow the example in [examples/humid.tf](examples/humid.tf). You may notice that it bears a lot of similarity to the `hashicorp/random` provider - that's because that's what I based this off.

## Contributing

This is my first journey into creating my own Terraform provider and there isn't a lot of information out there to help. If you see some area for improvement, you're more than welcome to open an issue for it or even submit a pull request with fixes.
